### Step 2: **Clone your forked repo**
Open a terminal (or Git Bash) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gui-workshop.git
cd gui-workshop
```

### Step 3: **Create a Python virtual environment**
```

## Part 2 - **Designing your UI**
We‚Äôll be using Qt Designer (inside Qt Creator) to visually build your app‚Äôs layout.

Step-by-Step to Create a UI File:
1. Open Qt Creator
2. Go to File > New File or Project
3. Select Qt > Qt Widgets Designer Form
4. Choose Main Window, then click Continue
5. Keep the file name as mainwindow.ui
6. Save the file inside your cloned repo folder (e.g., gui-workshop/)
7. When prompted about version control, choose ‚ÄúNone‚Äù
8. Click Finish

‚úÖ You‚Äôve now created a .ui file! This is the base of your GUI.

Designing your .ui file
follow Kaylee's instructions
edit this bit and put in specifics

To compile your ui file to python
`pyside6-uic mainwindow.ui -o mainwindow.py`
